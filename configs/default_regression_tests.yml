# # Example of some test cases
# # They will try to cover as many possible use cases as possible
# # The idea is that the CUI corresponding to the name is expected to be
# # obtained by MedCAT
# # Only the 'filters' under 'targeting' and the 'phrases' under
# # the test case are the two required sections, the rest is optional 
#
# test-case-name-1: # name of this test case
#   targeting: # info regarding targets of this test case
#     strategy: "ALL" # the strategy for dealing with the filters below
#                     # so "ALL" means the targets need to match all the below filters
#                     # and "ANY" means that the targets need to match at least one of the filters
#                     # if only one type of target it specified, this is irrelevant
#                     # the default value is "ALL" if not specified
#     prefname-only: False # set to True if only prefered names should be checked (defaults to False)
#     targfiltersets: # the filters for this specific test case
#                     # there has to be one type of target, but multiple can be specified
#                     # if multiple types are target, the strategy defined above is taken into affect
#                     # each type can specify one or multiple values
#                     #  this example shows has one values
