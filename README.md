MedCAT can be used to extract information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and link it to biomedical ontologies like SNOMED-CT and UMLS. Paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01165).

## Available Models

We have 4 public models available:
1) UMLS Small (A modelpack containing a subset of UMLS (disorders, symptoms, medications...). Trained on MIMIC-III)
2) SNOMED International (Full SNOMED modelpack trained on MIMIC-III)
3) UMLS Dutch v1.10 (a modelpack provided by UMC Utrecht containing [UMLS entities with Dutch names](https://github.com/umcu/dutch-umls) trained on Dutch medical wikipedia articles and a negation detection model [repository](https://github.com/umcu/negation-detection/)/[paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2209.00470) trained on EMC Dutch Clinical Corpus).
4) UMLS Full. >4MM concepts trained self-supervsied on MIMIC-III. v2022AA of UMLS.

To download any of these models, please [follow this link](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/login?service=https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/auth-callback) and sign into your NIH profile / UMLS license. You will then be redirected to the MedCAT model download form. Please complete this form and you will be provided a download link.

- **General \[1. April 2021\]**: MedCAT is upgraded to v1, unforunately this introduces breaking changes with older models (MedCAT v0.4),
  as well as potential problems with all code that used the MedCAT package. MedCAT v0.4 is available on the legacy
  branch and will still be supported until 1. July 2021
  (with respect to potential bug fixes), after it will still be available but not updated anymore.

## Demo
A demo application is available at [MedCAT](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk). This was trained on MIMIC-III and all of SNOMED-CT.

## Tutorials
A guide on how to use MedCAT is available at [MedCAT Tutorials](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATtutorials). Read more about MedCAT on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/medcat-introduction-analyzing-electronic-health-records-e1c420afa13a).

## Logging
Since MedCAT is primarily a library, logging has been effectively disabled by default. The idea is that the user of the library should have the choice of what, where, and how to log the information from a specific library they are using.

The idea is that the user can directly modify the logging behaviour of either the entire library or a certain set of modules within as they wish. We have provided a convenience method to add default handlers that log into the console as well as _medcat.log_ (`medcat.add_default_log_handlers`).

Some details as to how one can configure the logging are described in the [MedCAT Tutorials](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATtutorials).
PS: Currently (temporarily!) the tutorial is in the `tutorials` folder.

## Acknowledgements
Entity extraction was trained on [MedMentions](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/MedMentions) In total it has ~ 35K entites from UMLS

The vocabulary was compiled from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) In total ~ 800K unique words
