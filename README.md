# Medical  <img src="https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/blob/master/media/cat-logo.png" width=45> oncept Annotation Tool

MedCAT can be used to extract information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and link it to biomedical ontologies like SNOMED-CT and UMLS. Paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01165). 

## UPDATE
MedCAT is upgraded to v1, unforunately this introduces breaking changes with older models (MedCAT v0.4), as well as potential problems with all code that used the MedCAT package.

MedCAT v0.4 is available on the [legacy](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/tree/legacy) branch and will still be supported until 1. July 2021 (with respect to potential bug fixes), after it will still be available but not updated anymore.

## Demo
A demo application is available at [MedCAT](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk). This was trained on MIMIC-III and all of SNOMED-CT.

## Tutorial
A guide on how to use MedCAT is available in the [tutorial](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/tree/master/tutorial) folder. Read more about MedCAT on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/medcat-introduction-analyzing-electronic-health-records-e1c420afa13a).

## Install using PIP (Requires Python 3.6.1+)
1. Install MedCAT 

- For macOS: `pip install --upgrade medcat`
- For Windows/Linux (see [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)): `pip install --upgrade medcat -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`

2. Get the scispacy models:

`pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.3.0/en_core_sci_md-0.3.0.tar.gz`

3. Download the Vocabulary and CDB from the Models section below

4. Quickstart:
```python
from medcat.vocab import Vocab
from medcat.cdb import CDB
from medcat.cat import CAT

# Load the vocab model you downloaded
vocab = Vocab.load(vocab_path)
# Load the cdb model you downloaded
cdb = CDB.load('<path to the cdb file>') 

# Create cat - each cdb comes with a config that was used
#to train it. You can change that config in any way you want, before or after creating cat.
cat = CAT(cdb=cdb, config=cdb.config, vocab=vocab)

# Test it
text = "My simple document with kidney failure"
doc_spacy = cat(text)
# Print detected entities
print(doc_spacy.ents)

# Or to get an array of entities, this will return much more information
#and usually easier to use unless you know a lot about spaCy
doc = cat.get_entities(text)
print(doc)


# To train on one example
_ = cat(text, do_train=True)

# To train on a iterator over documents
data_iterator = <your iterator>
cat.train(data_iterator)

#Once done, save the new CDB
cat.cdb.save(<save path>)
```


## Models
A basic trained model is made public for the vocabulary and CDB. It is trained for the ~ 35K concepts available in `MedMentions`. 

Vocabulary [Download](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/media/vocab.dat) - Built from MedMentions

CDB [Download](https://medcat.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/media/cdb-medmen-v1.dat) - Built from MedMentions


(Note: This is was compiled from MedMentions and does not have any data from [NLM](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) as
that data is not publicaly available.)

### SNOMED-CT and UMLS
If you have access to UMLS or SNOMED-CT and can provide some proof (a screenshot of the [UMLS profile page](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov//uts.html#profile) is perfect, feel free to redact all information you do not want to share), contact us - we are happy to share the pre-built CDB and Vocab for those databases.

Alternatively, you can build the CDBs for scratch from source data. We have used the below steps to build UMLS and SNOMED-CT (UK) for our experiments

#### Building Concept Databases from Scratch
We provide details to build both UMLS and SNOMED-CT concept databases. In both cases CSV files containing the source
data with required columns (column descriptions are provided in the [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nz2zMDQ3QrlTgpW7FfGaXeV1ZAtZeOe2#scrollTo=ptRmHln9k7hG). 
Given the CSV files the [prepare_cdb.py](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT/blob/master/medcat/prepare_cdb.py) script can be used to build a CDB.
 
##### Building a UMLS Concept Database
The UMLS can be downloaded from https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html in the 
Rich Release Format (RRF). To make subsetting and filtering easier we import UMLS RRF into a PostgreSQL database 
(scripts available at [here](https://github.com/w-is-h/umls)).

Once the data is in the database we can use the following SQL script to download the CSV files containing all concepts 
that will form our CDB.

```
# Selecting concepts for all the Ontologies that are used
SELECT DISTINCT umls.mrconso.cui, str, mrconso.sab, mrconso.tty, tui, sty, def 
FROM umls.mrconso 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN umls.mrsty ON umls.mrsty.cui = umls.mrconso.cui 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN umls.mrdef ON umls.mrconso.cui = umls.mrdef.cui
WHERE lat='ENG'
```

##### Building a SNOMED-CT Concept Database
We use the SNOMED-CT data provided by the NHS TRUD service [https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/guest/group/0/pack/26](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/guest/group/0/pack/26). 
This release combines the International and UK specific concepts into a set of assets that can be parsed and loaded 
into a MedCAT CDB. We provide scripts for parsing the various release files and load into a MedCAT CDB instance. 
We provide further scripts to load accompanying SNOMED-CT Drug extension and clinical coding data 
(ICD / OPCS terminologies) also from the NHS TRUD service. Scripts are available at: [https://github.com/tomolopolis/SNOMED-CT_Analysis](https://github.com/tomolopolis/SNOMED-CT_Analysis) 


## TODO
- [ ] Switch to spaCy version 3+
- [ ] Enable automatic download of pre-built UMLS/SNOMED databases
- [ ] Enable spaCy serialization of documents (problem with `doc._.ents`)
- [ ] Update webapp to v1 and enable UMLS and SNOMED
- [ ] Fix logging, make sure the config options are respected 


## Acknowledgement
Entity extraction was trained on [MedMentions](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/MedMentions) In total it has ~ 35K entites from UMLS

The vocabulary was compiled from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) In total ~ 800K unique words
