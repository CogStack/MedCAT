She was found to be in mild to moderate CHF and an increase in her torsemide dose was recommended. On her way to a blood draw, while in the elevator, she had syncope and hit her head. The fall was witnessed by her daughter. There was no prodrome, no nausea, no incontinence with the fall. The pt does not have any seizure or hypoglycemia history. She notes an 8 lb wt gain over 2-3 weeks and denies dietary indiscretions. She takes her medications faithfully which include an escalating dose of torsemide in over the last several months. She's been hospitalized twice for CHF - once in 2075 and again in 11/77.\n\n\nThe pt was brought to the ED.

During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine.  In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart.  He denies SOB, N/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain.  He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins.  The arm pain is not exertional.\n\n\tAfter the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain.  A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis.  After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house.  He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking.  He denies BRBPR, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, palpitations, headache, fever or chills.\n\n\tIn the setting of significant fatigue and light-headedness, the pt presented to the ED this morning.  Admission vitals: 97.2, 120/78, HR 80's, RR12, sats 97% RA.  He was noted to be in A fib.  Hct was 22 (down from 38 last week).  NG lavage was not performed in the ED.  However, he did have another episode of bilateral arm pain which was relieved by SL TNG x 3.  HR at the time of arm pain was in the 80's and ECG showed A fib with possible TWI in I,L and V6 but relatively unchanged from admission ECG without pain.  He subsequently received lopressor 2.5 IV/12.5 PO, isordil 10 PO and zantac 50 IV.     \n\n\t  \n\nPMHx:\n\n1.\tCAD\n\na.\tS/p anterior MI 2082 - pt does not recall having chest pain associated with MI\n\nb.\tCath 2082 - 3 vessel CAD, PTCA to mid-LAD lesion, 90% RCA, occluded OM2\n\nc.\tETT-mibi 6/87 - 75% MPHR, 8 METS. 0.5-1 mm ST depressions in inferior and percordial (V4, V5) leads; imaging showed inferior and posterior ischemia\n\nd.\tECHO 3/87 - EF 67%, LA 37mm, no WMA \n\n2.\tBPH\n\n3.\tOA/DJD bilateral shoulders\n\n4.\tcolonoscopy 2087 - hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, single tubular adenoma excised; no endoscopy since then \n\n5.\tDM II - diet controlled; last A1c 6.6 (10/92)\n\n6.\thyperlipidemia - chol 111, LDL 55 HDL 33, tri 115 (10/92 on treatment)\n\n\n\nMeds:\n\n1.\tatenolol 100 QD\n\n2.\tisordil 30 QID\n\n3.\tASA 81 QD\n\n4.\tlisinopril 20 QD\n\n5.\tSL TNG prn\n\n6.\tMVI\n\n7.\tlipitor 10 QD\n\n\n\nAllergies: NKDA\n\n\n\nSHx: lives with wife; walks around the mall daily\n\nTobacco - quit >35 years ago\n\nEtOH - 2 mixed drinks (vodka) per night; denies anything more\n\nDrugs - none\n\n\n\nPE: vitals  95.0   115/58  87  18  98% RA\n\nGeneral: no acute distress\n\nHEENT: sclera anicteric; EOMI, PERRLA, OP without masses or infiltrate\n\nNECK: JVP flat; carotid pulses brisk and symmetric; no carotid bruits; no thyromegaly; no cervical or supraclav.

INR 0.9\n\n\n\nAssessment and plan:\n\n   40 y.o. with multiple risk factors for CAD. HTN, high chol, IDDM. Previous LAD stent with restenosis. Then second LAD stent and finally RCA stent. Now with admit for NSTEMI. Transferred for urgent cath. Plan for eventual renal transplant at CVH (had been waiting for Plavix to be completed). Pre-treated with mucomyst. \n\n\n\nGiven her previous restenosis, and the fact that further Plavix courses are postponing her renal transplant....she would be best served with CABG if she has restenosis. \n\n\n\nFurther plan per Dr Rollins\n\nFollow up with Dr Eaves\n\n\n\nFrances Travis Potts NP\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to Medications this visit\n\nDiovan 160mg  po qd Start: 09/28/2094\n\nLasix 80 mg  po qd Start: 09/28/2094\n\nToprol XL 25 mg  po qd Start: 09/28/2094 just increased to 50\n\nNorvasc 5mg  po q pm Start: 09/28/2094\n\nPlavix 75mg  po qd Start: 09/28/2094\n\nNiaspan 1000mg SR  po qhs Start: 09/28/2094\n\nVytorin 10mg/80mg  po qhs Start: 09/28/2094\n\nfolic acid 1 mg  po qd Start: 09/28/2094\n\nEpogen 10000u  sc sundays Start: 09/28/2094\n\nmultivitamins 1 tab  po qd Start: 09/28/2094\n\niron supplement 325mg  po am Start: 09/28/2094\n\nColace 100 mg  po qd Start: 09/28/2094\n\nisosorbide dinitrate     Start: 09/28/2094\n\nerythromycin 333mg  po TID Start: 09/28/2094 for gastroparesis\n\nPhoslo and vitamin B 1    Start: 09/28/2094\n\nInsulin pump    \n\n\n\nSigned electronically by   Frances T Potts NP  on  Dec 26, 2094     \n\n\n\n", "name": "231-02.xml", "annotations": [{"start": "16", "end": "26", "cui": "DATE", "value": "2094-12-26"}, {"start": "40", "end": "64", "cui": "HOSPITAL", "value": "COQUILLE VALLEY HOSPITAL"}, {"start": "242", "end": "256", "cui": "DATE", "value": "spring of 2094"}, {"start": "294", "end": "306", "cui": "DOCTOR", "value": "Bonnie Eaves"}, {"start": "572", "end": "578", "cui": "DATE", "value": "8/2094"}, {"start": "591", "end": "594", "cui": "HOSPITAL", "value": "CVH"}, {"start": "627", "end": "633", "cui": "DOCTOR", "value": "Vitale"}, {"start": "972", "end": "981", "cui": "DATE", "value": "9/29/2094"}, {"start": "1253", "end": "1258", "cui": "DATE", "value": "10/94"}, {"start": "1464", "end": "1469", "cui": "DATE", "value": "12/25"}, {"start": "1505", "end": "1508", "cui": "HOSPITAL", "value": "SMM"}, {"start": "1645", "end": "1648", "cui": "HOSPITAL", "value": "CVH"}, {"start": "1715", "end": "1719", "cui": "DATE", "value": "2093"}, {"start": "1805", "end": "1810", "cui": "DATE", "value": "10/94"}, {"start": "1829", "end": "1833", "cui": "DATE", "value": "2093"}, {"start": "1919", "end": "1932", "cui": "DOCTOR", "value": "Orlando Ernst"}, {"start": "1956", "end": "1963", "cui": "DOCTOR", "value": "Ratliff"}, {"start": "2265", "end": "2272", "cui": "DATE", "value": "sundays"}, {"start": "2651", "end": "2655", "cui": "AGE", "value": "60's"}, {"start": "2778", "end": "2790", "cui": "PROFESSION", "value": "Patternmaker"}, {"start": "2794", "end": "2797", "cui": "ORGANIZATION", "value": "IMN"}, {"start": "2801", "end": "2822", "cui": "PROFESSION", "value": "volunteer firefighter"}, {"start": "4015", "end": "4017", "cui": "AGE", "value": "40"}, {"start": "4256", "end": "4259", "cui": "HOSPITAL", "value": "CVH"}, {"start": "4531", "end": "4538", "cui": "DOCTOR", "value": "Rollins"}, {"start": "4558", "end": "4563", "cui": "DOCTOR", "value": "Eaves"}, {"start": "4567", "end": "4587", "cui": "DOCTOR", "value": "Frances Travis Potts"}, {"start": "4658", "end": "4668", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "4696", "end": "4706", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "4738", "end": "4748", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "4799", "end": "4809", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "4837", "end": "4847", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "4882", "end": "4892", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "4927", "end": "4937", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "4969", "end": "4979", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "4999", "end": "5006", "cui": "DATE", "value": "sundays"}, {"start": "5014", "end": "5024", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "5060", "end": "5070", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "5108", "end": "5118", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "5148", "end": "5158", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "5192", "end": "5202", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "5238", "end": "5248", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "5301", "end": "5311", "cui": "DATE", "value": "09/28/2094"}, {"start": "5360", "end": "5375", "cui": "DOCTOR", "value": "Frances T Potts"}, {"start": "5384", "end": "5396", "cui": "DATE", "value": "Dec 26, 2094"}]}, {"text": "\n\n\nRecord date: 2069-11-18\n\nHPI\n\n54 yo F with h/o CRI, DM on insulin, HTN, obesity, GERD, glaucoma, anemia, p/f for f/u. \n\nShe is generally doing well and has no complaints.
