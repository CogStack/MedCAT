Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,OBJECTIVE: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,ASSESSMENT,ORAL STAGE:,  Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.  Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,  No aspiration was noted during this evaluation.  Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid.  The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: ,Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.,PLAN: , Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:,1.  The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.,3.  The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function.,The patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services.", "last_modified": "2020-03-29 14:43:25.537525+00:00", "annotations": [{"id": 43938, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0017168", "value": "gastroesophageal reflux", "start": 332, "end": 355, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:03:14.959526+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 0.5474429308257066, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Other", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 43939, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0020538", "value": "hypertension", "start": 255, "end": 267, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:03:10.413705+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 0.6947173950416801, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 43940, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0038454", "value": "stroke", "start": 276, "end": 282, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:03:12.153821+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 43941, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0007787", "value": "TIA", "start": 272, "end": 275, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:03:11.486807+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 0.6191980000088091, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}]}, {"id": 3205, "name": "1605", "text": "CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Chest pain and fever.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This 48-year-old white married female presents in the emergency room after two days of increasing fever with recent diagnosis of urinary tract infection on outpatient treatment with nitrofurantoin.

"HISTORY: , A 34-year-old male presents today self-referred at the recommendation of Emergency Room physicians and his nephrologist to pursue further allergy evaluation and treatment.  Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic reaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies.  In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology uncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring dialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt infection.  In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but has never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions.  He currently is not taking any medication for allergies.  He is taking atenolol for blood pressure control.  No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine therapy and monitoring.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  History of urticaria, history of renal failure with hypertension possible source of renal failure, history of dialysis times 2 years and a history of hypertension.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  PermCath insertion times 3 and peritoneal dialysis.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease, carcinoma, and a history of food allergies, and there is also a history of hypertension.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Atenolol, sodium bicarbonate, Lovaza, and Dialyvite.,ALLERGIES: , Heparin causing thrombocytopenia.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Denies tobacco or alcohol use.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 34, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 70, temperature is 97.8, weight is 207 pounds, and height is 5 feet 7 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.,EARS:  The tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally with a good light reflex.  The external auditory canals are clear with no lesions or masses noted.  Weber and Rinne tests are within normal limits.,NOSE:  The nasal cavities are patent bilaterally.  The nasal septum is midline.  There are no nasal discharges.  No masses or lesions noted.,THROAT:  The oral mucosa appears healthy.  Dental hygiene is maintained well.  No oropharyngeal masses or lesions noted.  No postnasal drip noted.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Acute allergic reaction, etiology uncertain, however, suspicious for Keflex.,2.  Renal failure requiring dialysis.,3.  Hypertension.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,RAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergies was performed, and we will get the results back to the patient with further recommendations to follow.  If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity scale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions.  At this point, I would recommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider this an allergy.  Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this time and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions.  An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic reaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for

She is a pleasant 73-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain, lumbar degenerative disc disease, lumbar spondylosis, facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis primarily bilateral recess, intermittent lower extremity radiculopathy, DJD of both knees, bilateral pes anserinus bursitis, and chronic pain syndrome.  Dr. XYZ had performed right and left facet and sacroiliac joint injections, subsequent right L3 to S1 medial branch blocks and radiofrequency ablation on the right from L3 to S1.  She was subsequently seen with some mid back pain and she had right T8-T9 and T9-T10 facet injections on 10/28/2004.  She was last seen on 04/08/2005 with recurrent pain in her low back on the right.  Dr. XYZ repeated her radiofrequency ablation on the right side from L3-S1 on 05/04/2005.,The patient comes back to see me today.  She states that the radiofrequency ablation has helped her significantly there, but she still has one spot in her low back that seems to be hurting her on the right, and seems to be pointing to her right sacroiliac joint.  She is also complaining of pain in both knees.  She says that 20 years ago she had a cortisone shot in her knees, which helped her significantly.  She has not had any x-rays for quite some time.  She is taking some Lortab 7.5 mg tablets, up to four daily, which help her with her pain symptoms.  She is also taking Celebrex through Dr. S\u2019 office.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unchanged from my visit of 04/08/2005.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female.,Vital Signs:  Height is 5 feet 5 inches.  Weight is 183 pounds.  She is afebrile.,HEENT:  Benign.,Neck:  Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's.,Musculoskeletal:  Examination shows degenerative joint disease of both knees, with medial and lateral joint line tenderness, with tenderness at both pes anserine bursa.  Straight leg raises are negative bilaterally.  Posterior tibials are palpable bilaterally.,Skin and Lymphatics:  Examination of the skin does not reveal any additional scars, rashes, cafe au lait spots or ulcers.  No significant lymphadenopathy noted.,Spine:  Examination shows decreased lumbar lordosis with tenderness that seems to be in her right sacroiliac joint.  She has no other major tenderness.  Spinal movements are limited but functional.,Neurological:  She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect.  She has normal tone and coordination.  Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical.  Sensation is intact to pinprick.,FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION:,  Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Low back syndrome with lumbar degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, and facet joint syndrome on the right L4-5 and L5-S1.,2.  Improved, spinal right L3-S1 radiofrequency ablation.,3.  Right sacroiliac joint sprain/strain, symptomatic.,4.  Left lumbar facet joint syndrome, stable.,6.  Right thoracic facet joint syndrome, stable.,7.  Lumbar spinal stenosis, primarily lateral recess with intermittent lower extremity radiculopathy, stable.,8.  Degenerative disc disease of both knees, symptomatic.,9.  Pes anserinus bursitis, bilaterally symptomatic.,10.  Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  She has some symptoms in her low back on the right side at the sacroiliac joint.  Dr. XYZ will plan having her come in and injecting her right sacroiliac joint under fluoroscopy.  She is also having pain in both knees.  We will plan on x-rays of both knees, AP and lateral, and plan on seeing her back on Monday or Friday for possible intraarticular and/or pes anserine bursa injections bilaterally.  I explained the rationale for each of these injections, possible complications and she wishes to proceed.  In the interim, she can continue on Lortab and Celebrex.  We will plan for the follow up following these interventions, sooner if needed.  She voiced understanding and agreement.  Physical exam findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.", "last_modified": "2020-03-29 14:43:25.542510+00:00",

This has been problematic over the last several months and is just worsening to the point where it is impairing her work.  Her boss asks her if she was actually on drugs in which she said no.  She stated may be she needed to be, meaning taking some medications.  The patient had been prescribed Wellbutrin in the past and responded well to it; however, at that time it was prescribed for obsessive-compulsive type disorder relating to overeating and therefore her insurance would not cover the medication.  She has not been on any other antidepressants in the past.  She is not having any suicidal ideation but is having difficulty concentrating, rapid mood swings with tearfulness, and insomnia.  She denies any hot flashes or night sweats.  She underwent TAH with BSO in December of 2003.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Benign breast lump in her mother; however, her paternal grandmother had breast cancer.  The patient denies any palpitations, urinary incontinence, hair loss, or other concerns.  She was recently treated for sinusitis.,ALLERGIES:,  She is allergic to Sulfa.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Recently finished Minocin and Duraphen II DM.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,General:  A well-developed and well-nourished female, conscious, alert, oriented times three in no acute distress.  Mood is dysthymic.  Affect is tearful.,Skin:  Without rash.,Eyes:  PERRLA.  Conjunctivae are clear.,Neck:  Supple with adenopathy or thyromegaly.,Lungs:  Clear.,Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Postsurgical menopause.,2.  Mood swings.,PLAN:,  I spent about 30 minutes with the patient discussing treatment options.  I do believe that her moods would greatly benefit from hormone replacement therapy; however, she is reluctant to do this because of family history of breast cancer.  We will try starting her back on Wellbutrin XL 150 mg daily.  She may increase to 300 mg daily after three to seven days.  Samples provided initially.  If she is not obtaining adequate relief from medication alone, we will then suggest that we explore the use of hormone replacement therapy.  I also recommended increasing her exercise.  We will also obtain some screening lab work including CBC, UA, TSH, chemistry panel, and lipid profile.  Follow up here in two weeks or sooner if any other problems.

who was seen for evaluation at the request of Dr. X regarding recurrent jaw pain.  This patient has been having what he described as numbness and tingling along the jaw, teeth, and tongue.  This numbness has been present for approximately two months.  It seems to be there \"all the time.\"  He was seen by his dentist and after dental evaluation was noted to be \"okay.\"  He had been diagnosed with a throat infection about a week ago and is finishing a course of Avelox at this time.  He has been taking cough drops and trying to increase his fluids.  He has recently stopped tobacco.  He has been chewing tobacco for about 30 years.  Again, there is concern regarding the numbness he has been having.  He has had a loss of sensation of taste as well.  Numbness seems to be limited just to the left lateral tongue and the jaw region and extends from the angle of the jaw to the lip.  He does report he has had about a 20-pound of weight gain over the winter, but notes he has had this in the past just simply from decreased activity.  He has had no trauma to the face.  He does note a history of headaches.  These are occasional and he gets these within the neck area when they do flare up.  The headaches are noted to be less than one or two times per month.  The patient does note he has a history of anxiety disorder as well.  He has tried to eliminate his amount of tobacco and he is actually taking Nicorette gum at this time.  He denies any fever or chills.  He is not having any dental pain with biting down.  He has had no jaw popping and no trismus noted.

She knows me through the operating room and has asked me to possibly perform cosmetic surgery on her.  She is very bright and well informed about cosmetic surgery.  She has recently had some neck surgery for a re-fusion of her neck and is currently on methadone for chronic pain regarding this.  Her current desires are that she obtain a breast augmentation and liposuction of her abdomen, and she came to me mostly because I offer transumbilical breast augmentation.  Her breasts are reportedly healthy without any significant problems.  Her weight is currently stable.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: ,  Negative.  Past surgical history is significant for a second anterior cervical fusion and diskectomy in 02/05 and in 09/06.  She has had no previous cosmetic or aesthetic surgery.,FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for Huntington disease in her mother and diabetes in her father.  Her brother has an aneurysm.  She does occasionally smoke and has been trying to quit recently.  She is currently smoking about a pack a day.  She drinks about once a week.  She is currently a registered nurse, circulator, and scrub technician in the operating room at Hopkins.  She has no children.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,A 12-system review is significant for some musculoskeletal pain, mostly around her neck and thoracic region.  She does have occasional rash on her chest and problems with sleep and anxiety that are related to her chronic pain.  She has considered difficult airway due to anterior cervical disk fusion and instability.  Her last mammogram was in 2000.  She has a size 38C breast.,MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are 5 mg of methadone three times a day and amitriptyline at night as needed.,ALLERGIES: , None.,FINDINGS: , On exam today, the patient has good posture, good physique, good skin tone.  She is tanned.  Her lower abdomen has some excess adiposity.  There is some mild laxity of the lower abdominal skin.  Her umbilicus is oval shaped and of adequate caliber for a transumbilical breast augmentation.  There was no piercing in that region.  Her breasts are C shaped.  They are not ptotic.  They have good symmetry with no evidence of tubular breast deformity.  She has no masses or lesions noted.  The nipples are of appropriate size and shape for a woman of her age.  Her scar on her neck from her anterior cervical disk fusion is well healed.  Hopefully, our scars would be similar to this.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Hypomastia.  I think her general physique and body habitus would accommodate about 300 to 350 cubic centimeter implant nicely.  This would make her fill out her clothes much better, and I think transumbilical technique in her is a good option.  I have discussed with her the other treatment options, and she does not want scars around her breasts if at all possible.  I think her lower abdominal skin is of good tone.  I think suction lipectomy in this region would bring down her size and accentuate her waist nicely.  I am a little concerned about the lower abdominal skin laxity, and I will discuss with her further that in the near future if this continues to be a problem, she may need a mini tummy tuck.  I do think that a liposuction is a reasonable alternative and we could see how much skin tightening she gets after the adiposity is removed.  I will try to set this up in the near future.  I will try to set this up to get the instrumentation from the instrumentation rep for the transumbilical breast augmentation procedure.  Due to her neck issues, we may not be able to perform her surgery but I will check with Dr. X to see if she is comfortable giving her deep sedation and no general anesthetic with her neck being fused.", "last_modified": "2020-03-29 14:43:25.604302+00:00", "annotations": [{"id": 44109, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0700201", "value": "problems with sleep", "start": 1560, "end": 1579, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:13:53.879528+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44110, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0020179", "value": "Huntington disease", "start": 1020, "end": 1038, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:13:24.204886+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Other", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44111, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0010495", "value": "skin laxity", "start": 3201, "end": 3212, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:13:58.084417+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44112, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0011847", "value": "diabetes", "start": 1057, "end": 1065, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:13:30.809160+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 0.5561598859665859, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Other", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44113, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0729233", "value": "thoracic", "start": 1495, "end": 1503, "validated": true, "correct": false, "deleted": true, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:13:52.360059+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 0.27430375628183123, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44114, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0003467", "value": "anxiety", "start": 1584, "end": 1591, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:13:56.796450+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 0.5804359411854729, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}]}, {"id": 3332, "name": "1067", "text": "Chief Complaint:, Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.,History of Present Illness:, A 50-year-old Asian female comes to The Methodist Hospital on January 2, 2001, complaining of a 3-day history of abdominal pain.

female who is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.  The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often \"no.\"  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded \"no\" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered \"no\" to all \"yes/no\" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated \"I can't\".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple \"yes/no\" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):,  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.", "last_modified": "2020-03-29 14:43:25.605620+00:00", "annotations": [{"id": 44146, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0281875", "value": "illegal drug use", "start": 839,

pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.  Attention deficit disorder.,2.  TMJ arthropathy.,3.  Migraines.,4.  Osteoarthritis as described above.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,1.  Cystectomies.,2.  Sinuses.,3.

right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02.  She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Negative aside from above.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,Please see above.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative aside from above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress.  Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right.  She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows.  She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation.  She has a positive impingement sign on the right.,ASSESSMENT:,  Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy.,DISCUSSION: , With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition.  The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.", "last_modified": "2020-03-29 14:43:25.612194+00:00", "annotations": [{"id": 44321, "user": "wish", "cui": "C4543028", "value": "right suprascapular neuropathy", "start": 700, "end": 730, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:24:46.601192+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Other", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44322, "user": "wish", "cui": "C4543028", "value": "right suprascapular neuropathy", "start": 2107, "end": 2137, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:24:52.892761+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44323, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0376685", "value": "shoulder impingement syndrome", "start": 2076, "end": 2105, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:24:50.858343+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}, {"name": "Status", "value": "Other", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44324, "user": "wish", "cui": "C3662000", "value": "suprascapular neuropathy", "start": 2417, "end": 2441, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:25:13.814847+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44325, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0700251", "value": "brachial plexopathy", "start": 504, "end": 523, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:24:32.110979+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 0.48277480589926647, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44326, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0700594", "value": "radiculopathy", "start": 745, "end": 758, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:24:48.775938+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Other", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}, {"name": "Status", "value": "Other", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}, {"id": 44327, "user": "wish", "cui": "C0027813", "value": "neuritis", "start": 574, "end": 582, "validated": true, "correct": true, "deleted": false, "alternative": false, "killed": false, "last_modified": "2020-03-29 15:24:35.130203+00:00", "manually_created": false, "acc": 1.0, "meta_anns": [{"name": "Status", "value": "Confirmed", "acc": 1.0, "validated": true}]}]}, {"id": 3350, "name": "864", "text": "MEDICATIONS: , Plavix, atenolol, Lipitor, and folic acid.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,This is a 41-year-old male patient who comes in with chest pain, had had a previous MI in 07/2003 and stents placement in 2003, who comes in for a stress myocardial perfusion scan.,With the patient at rest, 10.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.,PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION:  ,The patient exercised for a total of 12 minutes on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 12.8 METS.  The resting heart rate was 57 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 123 beats per minute, which was 69% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with a resting blood pressure of 130/100 and a peak blood pressure of 158/90.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and leg pain.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm.  The peak stress EKG did not reveal any ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities.  There was ventricular bigeminy seen during exercise, but no sustained tachycardia was seen.  At peak, there was no chest pain noted.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and left pain.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting myocardial perfusion imaging.,MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:,1.  The overall quality of the scan was good.,2.  There was no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.,3.  The left ventricular cavity appeared normal in size.,4.  Gated SPECT images revealed mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.,CONCLUSIONS:,1.  Good exercise tolerance.,2.  Less than adequate cardiac stress.  The patient was on beta-blocker therapy.,3.  No EKG evidence of stress induced ischemia.,4.  No chest pain with stress.,5.  Mild ventricular bigeminy with exercise.,6.
